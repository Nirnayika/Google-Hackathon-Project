                <h1>Food and Nutrition</h1>
                <p> Nutrition begins with food. Nutrition is the process by which the body nourishes itself by transforming food into energy and body tissues. The science of nutrition concerns everything the body does with food to carry on its functions. Food provides essential substances called nutrients. The term nutrition can also refer to the quality of someone’s food choices, or diet. A balanced diet is one in which foods eaten on a regular basis provide all the nutrients needed in the right amounts. A balanced diet has many benefits. It can help people feel and look their best. It can also help them stay energetic and healthy, both in the short term and later in life.</p>

                <h1>Nutrients</h1>
                <p> Nutrients are substances that are essential for the growth, development, and maintenance of the human body.
                    A well-balanced diet is essential for good health, and it should include a variety of foods from different food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Each food group provides essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein that are necessary for the body to function properly.
                    Proper nutrition is important for maintaining a healthy weight, preventing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, and for promoting overall health and well-being. It can also play a crucial role in supporting the immune system, reducing inflammation, and promoting good mental health.
                    There are six main types of nutrients that are required by the body, each with its own unique function:
                    <br><b>Carbohydrates:</b> Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. They are found in foods such as bread, pasta, rice, and fruits.
                    <br><b>Proteins:</b> Proteins are the building blocks of the body. They are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of the body's tissues. Foods such as meat, fish, eggs, and beans are good sources of protein.
                    <br><b>Fats:</b> Fats provide the body with energy and help to absorb certain vitamins. However, not all fats are healthy, and some can increase the risk of heart disease. Foods such as nuts, seeds, and fish are good sources of healthy fats.
                    <br><b>Vitamins:</b> Vitamins are essential nutrients that the body needs in small amounts to function properly. There are 13 essential vitamins, including vitamins A, C, D, E, and K.
                    <br><b>Minerals:</b> Minerals are also essential nutrients that the body needs in small amounts. They help to maintain the body's pH balance, regulate fluid balance, and aid in the formation of bones and teeth. Examples of minerals include calcium, iron, and potassium.
                    <br><b>Water: </b>Water is essential for life and makes up approximately 60% of the body's weight. It is necessary for a variety of bodily functions, including digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation.
