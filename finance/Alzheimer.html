                <p>
                    Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that gets worse over time. It's characterized by changes in the brain that lead to deposits of certain proteins. Alzheimer's disease causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to eventually die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia — a gradual decline in memory, thinking, behaviour and social skills. These changes affect a person's ability to function. In India, more than 4 million people have some form of dementia.

                <h1> Treatments</h1>
                <p> 
                    There is no known cure for Alzheimer’s disease. It is not possible to reverse the death of brain cells.
Treatments can, however, relieve its symptoms and improve quality of life for the person and their family and caregivers.
<br>The following are important elements of dementia care:
<br>•	effective management of any conditions occurring alongside Alzheimer’s
<br>•	activities and day care programs
<br>•	involvement of support groups and services
<br>Three common drugs with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat these symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are:
<br>•	donepezil (Aricept), to treat all stages
<br>•	galantamine (Razadyne), to treat mild-to-moderate stages
<br>•	rivastigmine (Exelon), to treat mild-to-moderate stages
<br>Another drug, called memantine (Namenda), has approval to treat moderate-to-severe Alzheimer’s disease. A combination of memantine and donepezil (Namzaric) is also available.
<br>Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition. A build-up of plaques and tangles in the brain, along with cell death, causes memory loss and cognitive decline.
<br>There is currently no cure, but drugs and other treatments can help slow or ease the cognitive, emotional, and behavioural symptoms and improve the person’s quality of life.
<br>In addition, having support systems in place and the use of non-pharmacologic behavioural interventions can improve quality of life for both people with dementia and their caregivers and families. This includes:
<br>•	Treatment of co-existing medical conditions
<br>•	Coordination of care among health care professionals
