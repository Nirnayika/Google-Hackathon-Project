                <h1>Cancer</h1>
                <p> Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body.
                    Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world. But survival rates are improving for many types of cancer, thanks to improvements in cancer screening, treatment and prevention.</p>

                <h1>Stages of Cancer</h1>
                <p>
                    Most cancers have four stages. The specific stage is determined by a few different factors, including the tumour’s size and location:
                   <br> Stage I: The cancer is localized to a small area and hasn’t spread to lymph nodes or other tissues.
                   <br> Stage II: The cancer has grown, but it hasn’t spread.
                   <br> Stage III: The cancer has grown larger and has possibly spread to lymph nodes or other tissues.
                   <br> Stage IV: The cancer has spread to other organs or areas of your body. This stage is also referred to as metastatic or advanced cancer.
                    Though stages one through four are the most common, there’s also a Stage 0. This earliest phase describes cancer that’s still localized to the area in which it started. Cancers that are still in Stage 0 are usually easily treatable and are considered pre-cancerous by most healthcare providers.

                <h1> SYMPTOMS:-   </h1>
                <p> Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected.
                    Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include:
                  <br>  1.Fatigue

                  <br>5.	Changes in bowel or bladder habits
                  <br>6.	Persistent cough or trouble breathing

                <h1>•	CANCER TREATMENT :-</h1>
            
                <p>
                    Cancer treatment can include different options, depending on the type of cancer and how advanced it is.
                  <br> 1.	Localized treatment. Localized treatment usually involves using treatments like surgery or local radiation therapy at a specific area of the body or tumour.
                    <br>2.	Systemic treatment. Systemic drug treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, can affect the entire body.
                    <br>3.	Palliative treatment. Palliative care involves relieving health symptoms associated with cancer, such as trouble breathing and pain.
                    Different cancer treatments are often used together to remove or destroy as many cancerous cells as possible.
                    <br>A.Surgery:-Surgery removes as much of the cancer as possible. Surgery is often used in combination with some other therapy in order to make sure all of the cancer cells are gone.
                    <br>B.Chemotherapy:-Chemotherapy is a form of aggressive cancer treatment that uses medications that are toxic to cells to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. It may be used to shrink the size of a tumor or the number of cells in your body and lower the likelihood of the cancer spreading.
                    <br>C.	Radiation therapy:-	Radiation therapy uses powerful, focused beams of radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy done inside of your body is called brachytherapy, while radiation therapy done outside of your body is called external beam radiation.
                    <br>D. cell (bone marrow) transplant:-This treatment repairs diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can have a variety of functions. These transplants allow doctors to use higher doses of chemotherapy to treat the cancer. A stem cell transplant is commonly used to treat leukaemia.
                    <br>E.Immunotherapy (biological therapy):-Immunotherapy uses your body’s own immune system to attack cancer cells. These therapies help your antibodies recognize the cancer, so they can use your body’s natural defences to destroy cancer cells.
                    <br>F.Hormone therapy:-Hormone therapy removes or blocks hormones that fuel certain cancers to stop cancer cells from growing. This therapy is a common treatment for cancers that may use hormones to grow and spread, such as certain types of breast cancer and prostate cancer.
                    <br>G.Targeted drug therapy:-Targeted drug therapy uses drugs to interfere with certain molecules that help cancer cells grow and survive. Genetic testing may reveal if you are eligible for this type of therapy. It may depend on the type of cancer you have and the genetic mutations and molecular characteristics of your tumour.
                    <br>H.Clinical trials:-Clinical trials investigate new ways to treat cancer. This may include testing the effectiveness of drugs that have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but for other purposes. It can also include trying new drugs. Clinical trials can offer another option for people who may have not seen the level of success they wanted with conventional treatments. In some cases, this treatment may be provided for free.

                    Alternative medicine may be used to complement another form of treatment. It may help decrease symptoms of cancer and side effects of cancer treatment, such as nausea, fatigue, and pain. Alternative medicine for cancer can include:
                  <br>  •	acupuncture
                  <br>  •	yoga
                   <br> •	massage
                   <br> •	meditation

                <h1>FINANCIAL ADVICE(Utilize financial aid to cover the costs of cancer treatment)</h1>
                <p>Cancer destroys not just the body and mind, but a family’s finance. By the time it is done, it makes sure there is nothing left to build. General health insurance does not help, and even the most comprehensive plans cannot cover for the entire treatment. The logical step would be to get a critical illness cover.

                  <br>  Here are some government schemes and non-government schemes that can help you fund your cancer treatment:-

                         Cancer Cure Fund is a flagship project which provides financial aid for treatment to underprivileged cancer patients. Many cancers are treatable, if detected early and treated in time. However, many cancer patients in India are not able to afford the treatment costs and therefore do not survive the disease. This project has transformed the lives of over thousands of patients across the country, many of whom have completed their treatment and returned to a productive life once again. This program is implemented at a pan India level and we are pleased to report that 45% of the beneficiaries are between 16-45 yrs. of age.
                         This project is a unique, first of its kind initiative in collaboration with HDFC AMC Ltd. In February 2011, HDFC AMC launched a Debt Mutual fund which gave the investors an option to donate 50% or 100% of their dividend income to Indian Cancer Society to fund the treatment cost for cancer patients. ICS is grateful to each of the 5000 investors who have donated their income to the Cancer Cure Fund. ICS appreciates the continued support of HDFC AMC which has helped save thousands of precious lives

                <p>
                    Crowd funding is the most popular form of non-governmental financial aid. It involves designing a campaign that summarises the condition. This works like a pitch used to approach NGOs and other fundraising organisations. These pitches are usually web-based and may charge certain amounts. However, with Ketto, this process can be more straightforward, as anyone can create a campaign with a zero per cent platform fee. All that is required is basic information, along with a few mandatory details. Any individual can start crowd funding campaign and raise financial help for cancer patients in India.
