                <p> Kidney disease means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes or high blood pressure. If you experience kidney failure, treatments include kidney transplant or dialysis.</p>

                <p> 
                    Fabry disease is a rare genetic disease that is passed down through your family. It affects organs all around your body, including your heart, brain and kidneys, and can cause them to get less blood than they need. Over time, this can cause chronic kidney disease or kidney failure.

                 <p>
                    Cystinosis is a rare disorder that allows a natural chemical called cystine to build up in your body and cause health problems. Kidney damage from cystinosis can cause kidney failure. People with cystinosis must take medicine to lower their cystine levels and may need a kidney transplant. Cystinosis is genetic (runs in families) and is most often diagnosed in young babies.

                <p>
                    Glomerulonephritis is when the tiny filters in your kidneys that clean your blood (glomeruli) are damaged and lose their ability to remove waste and fluid from your blood. Over time, this can cause kidney failure. Many health problems can cause glomerulonephritis and treatment depends on the cause.

                <p>
                    IgA nephropathy is a disease that causes proteins made by your immune system to build up in your kidneys and damage the tiny filters that clean your blood (glomeruli). This damage can take years to develop, and people with IgA nephropathy often do not know they have it. Over time, IgA nephropathy can lead to chronic kidney disease, kidney failure or death. There is no cure for IgA nephropathy, but medicines can slow the damage to your kidneys.

                    Lupus nephritis is an autoimmune disease (a disease that causes your body's immune system to attack its own tissues) that leads to pain, swelling and damage in your whole body, including your kidneys. This can lead to chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. The exact cause of lupus nephritis is unknown and it cannot be cured, but with treatment many people with lupus can lower their symptoms and prevent serious kidney damage.

                    aHUS (atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome) is a very rare genetic (runs in families) disease that causes tiny blood clots to form in the small blood vessels of your body. These clots can block the flow of blood to your kidneys and other organs and cause damage. Many people who have aHUS never have symptoms. For people who do have symptoms, they often start after a "triggering event", such as becoming pregnant or having cancer.

                        Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic (runs in families) disorder that causes cysts (growths filled with fluid) to form on your kidneys and other organs. These cysts can lower your kidney's ability to filter fluid and waste from your blood. Over time, PKD can cause kidney failure. There is no cure for PKD, but treatments can slow the growth of the cysts and prevent PKD symptoms from causing health problems.

                            <h1>Symptoms of kidney diseases:- </h1>
                            <p>
                               <br> 1.	You're more tired, have less energy or are having trouble concentrating. A severe decrease in kidney function can lead to a build-up of toxins and impurities in the blood. This can cause people to feel tired, weak and can make it hard to concentrate. Another complication of kidney disease is anaemia, which can cause weakness and fatigue.
                               <br> 2.	You're having trouble sleeping. When the kidneys aren't filtering properly, toxins stay in the blood rather than leaving the body through the urine. This can make it difficult to sleep. There is also a link between obesity and chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea is more common in those with chronic kidney disease, compared with the general population.
                               <br> 3.	You have dry and itchy skin. Healthy kidneys do many important jobs. They remove wastes and extra fluid from your body, help make red blood cells, help keep bones strong and work to maintain the right amount of minerals in your blood. Dry and itchy skin can be a sign of the mineral and bone disease that often accompanies advanced kidney disease, when the kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of minerals and nutrients in your blood.
                               <br>  4.	You feel the need to urinate more often. If you feel the need to urinate more often, especially at night, this can be a sign of kidney disease. When the kidneys filters are damaged, it can cause an increase in the urge to urinate. Sometimes this can also be a sign of a urinary infection or enlarged prostate in men.
                               <br>  5.	You see blood in your urine. Healthy kidneys typically keep the blood cells in the body when filtering wastes from the blood to create urine, but when the kidney's filters have been damaged, these blood cells can start to "leak" out into the urine. In addition to signaling kidney disease, blood in the urine can be indicative of tumors, kidney stones or an infection.
                               <br>  6.	Your urine is foamy. Excessive bubbles in the urine – especially those that require you to flush several times before they go away—indicate protein in the urine. This foam may look like the foam you see when scrambling eggs, as the common protein found in urine, albumin, is the same protein that is found in eggs.
                               <br>  7.	You're experiencing persistent puffiness around your eyes. Protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys’ filters have been damaged, allowing protein to leak into the urine. This puffiness around your eyes can be due to the fact that your kidneys are leaking a large amount of protein in the urine, rather than keeping it in the body.
                               <br>  8.	Your ankles and feet are swollen. Decreased kidney function can lead to sodium retention, causing swelling in your feet and ankles. Swelling in the lower extremities can also be a sign of heart disease, liver disease and chronic leg vein problems.
                               <br> 9.	You have a poor appetite. This is a very general symptom, but a buildup of toxins resulting from reduced kidney function can be one of the causes.
                               <br>  10.	Your muscles are cramping. Electrolyte imbalances can result from impaired kidney function. For example, low calcium levels and poorly controlled phosphorus may contribute to muscle cramping.

                                <p>
                                    Depending on the cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure.
                                    Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you might need treatment for end-stage kidney disease.
                                    
                                    </p>

                                    <h1>Treatment for end-stage kidney disease</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant.
                                       <br> •	Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood.
                                        In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it.
                                      <br>  •	Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors.
                                        After a transplant, you'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant.
                                        For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat your kidney failure with conservative measures. Conservative measures likely will include symptom management, advance care planning and care to keep you comfortable (palliative care).

                                            Kidney failure treatment—hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation—is expensive. Many people with kidney failure need help paying for their care.  It is a staggering fact that more than 8 million people in India are currently dealing with chronic kidney diseases. Every year, estimates suggest that over 2 lakh patients are diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease. The number of individuals in India with kidney-related conditions has almost doubled over the past 15 years.
                                            Although it's good news that most patients can recover from kidney diseases with timely treatment, the expenses related to treatment can cause financial stress for families who are already supporting their loved ones.
